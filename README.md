#Desafío del dígito base

Para encontrar el dígito base de un entero se tienen que seguir las siguientes reglas:

*

If  has only  digit, then its super digit is .
Otherwise, the super digit of  is equal to the super digit of the digit-sum of . Here, digit-sum of a number is defined as the sum of its digits.
For example, super digit of  will be calculated as:

super_digit(9875) = super_digit(9+8+7+5) 
                  = super_digit(29) 
                  = super_digit(2+9)
                  = super_digit(11)
                  = super_digit(1+1)
                  = super_digit(2)
                  = 2.
You are given two numbers  and . You have to calculate the super digit of .

 is created when number  is concatenated  times. That is, if  and , then .

Here  and , so .

super_digit(P) = super_digit(148148148) 
               = super_digit(1+4+8+1+4+8+1+4+8)
               = super_digit(39)
               = super_digit(3+9)
               = super_digit(12)
               = super_digit(1+2)
               = super_digit(3)
               = 3.
